# Part 1: Writing Novel Code, Introduction to PyBind

## Scenario

Thanks to your diligent work, on the last step, you have not been fired immediately. The company transfers you to train
under a QR, who immediately sets you to work on building a pricing utility using C++ that he can directly import using
Python. The Python script and pricing formula will be provided to help you with development.

Pricing formula is as follows:
Theoretical Value = (Previous Price _ (0.9 + Interest Rate)) _ Oleo Constant.You should take all 3 variables as input
floats into your function.

## Instructions

- [x] Read the given code, and attempt to understand it.
- [x] You will need to write your own `CMakeLists.txt`, though a `Taskfile.yml` has been provided so you can use the
      same commands that you did in Step 0. Research and create this.
- [x] Implement the pricing file - `PricingUtil.cpp` and `PricingUtil.h`.
- [x] Modify your `CMakeLists.txt` to emit a Pybind module.
- [x] Ensure the provided Python file can import your module without any issues.
